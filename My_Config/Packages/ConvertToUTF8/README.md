Configuration
------------------
Please check ConvertToUTF8.sublime-settings file for details. You should save your personal settings in a file named "ConvertToUTF8.sublime-settings" under "User" folder.

* encoding_list: encoding selection list when detection is failed
* max_cache_size: maximum encoding cache size, 0 means no cache (default: 100)
* max_detect_lines: maximum detection lines, 0 means unlimited (default: 600)
* preview_action: specific the action when previewing a file, available options: no_action, convert_and_open (default: no_action)
* convert_on_load: enable/disable convert file content to UTF-8 when it is loaded, available options: always, never (default: always)
* convert_on_save: enable/disable convert file from UTF-8 to a specific encoding when it is saved, available options: always, never (default: always)

Usage
------------------
In most cases, this plug-in will take care of encoding issues automatically.

You can also use the "File > Set File Encoding to" menu entry to transform between different encodings. For example, you can open a UTF-8 file, and save it to GBK, and vice versa.

Note:
* if "convert_on_save" is set to never, the file will *NEVER* be saved to the selected encoding
* please do not edit the file before the encoding detection process is finished
* please try either increasing the value of max_detect_lines or set the encoding manually if the detection result is not accurate


Q & A
------------------
* Q: It is not working after installation, how do I fix it?

  A: Please try the following steps:
  1. Restart Sublime Text
  2. Make sure the plug-in folder is named "ConvertToUTF8" (skip this step if you install via "Package Control")
  3. Install Python 2.6 manually if you are running Ubuntu 64bit
<code>  
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes  
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install python2.6  
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/python2.6 /PATH_TO_ST2/lib  
</code>
  4. Disable other encoding related plug-ins
  5. Contact me

* Q: Which encodings are supported?

  A: Any encoding your system supported should be fine.

* Q: Why does the content become a mess when the window is re-activated?

  A: This is caused by reloading and has been fixed, please update your *ConvertToUTF8* to latest version.

* Q: Why does ST2 ask me that file "Has changed on disk. Do you want to reload it?" when the window is re-activated.

  A: Same reason as above. Please choose "Cancel" if you have unsaved changes to the file.

* Q: When saving the file, Sublime Text tells me the file is saved as UTF-8, why?

  A: Don't worry, the plug-in will convert your file to original encoding.
